    "**Database:**\n",
    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored for efficient retrieval, manipulation, and management. Databases are used to store various types of data, including text, numbers, multimedia, and more. They play a crucial role in applications, allowing users and applications to store, retrieve, and manage data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difference between SQL and NoSQL Databases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL Databases (Relational Databases):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Structure:**\n",
    "   - **SQL databases**, also known as relational databases, are based on a fixed schema. The structure, relationships, and constraints of the data are defined in advance.\n",
    "   - Data is organized into tables with predefined columns and data types. Each row in the table represents a record, and tables can be related through foreign key relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scalability:**\n",
    "   - SQL databases are generally scaled vertically, meaning you can increase the load on a single server by increasing things like CPU, RAM, or SSD.\n",
    "   - Scaling can be expensive and has limits, making it challenging to handle large amounts of traffic and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Complex Queries:**\n",
    "   - SQL databases use Structured Query Language (SQL) for defining and manipulating the data. SQL provides powerful querying capabilities, including complex joins and transactions.\n",
    "   - These databases are suitable for applications where transactions and complex queries are essential, such as financial systems and traditional web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **ACID Transactions:**\n",
    "   - SQL databases adhere to ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring that database transactions are processed reliably even in the face of failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Examples:**\n",
    "   - Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NoSQL Databases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Structure:**\n",
    "   - **NoSQL databases**, also known as non-relational databases, have a dynamic schema. Data can be stored in various ways: document-oriented, key-value pairs, column-family, or graph databases.\n",
    "   - There is no fixed schema; each data entry can have different fields, allowing for more flexible and dynamic data models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scalability:**\n",
    "   - NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scalability, meaning they can be easily distributed across multiple servers.\n",
    "   - This scalability makes them well-suited for handling large volumes of traffic and data, common in modern web applications and big data scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Simplicity and Speed:**\n",
    "   - NoSQL databases are optimized for simple queries and fast read/write operations. They sacrifice some features of SQL databases for speed and flexibility.\n",
    "   - They are often used in applications requiring quick iteration and development, such as agile web and mobile applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Eventual Consistency:**\n",
    "   - NoSQL databases often prioritize performance and scalability over strict consistency. They might provide eventual consistency, where data changes are propagated to all nodes eventually but not immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Examples:**\n",
    "   - Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB (document-oriented), Redis (key-value store), Cassandra (column-family), and Neo4j (graph database).\n"

    "**DDL (Data Definition Language)** is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used for defining, managing, and controlling the structure of a database, including creating, altering, dropping, and truncating database objects. DDL statements are used to define and manage the schema and structure that hold the data in a database. Here's an explanation of the DDL statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **CREATE:**\n",
    "The `CREATE` statement is used to create new database objects, such as tables, indexes, or views. It defines the structure of the object being created.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example - Creating a Table:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
    "    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    FirstName VARCHAR(255),\n",
    "    LastName VARCHAR(255),\n",
    "    Age INT,\n",
    "    Department VARCHAR(255)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, a table named `Employees` is created with columns `EmployeeID`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, `Age`, and `Department`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **DROP:**\n",
    "The `DROP` statement is used to remove an existing database object, such as a table, index, or view, from the database. This operation irreversibly removes the object and all associated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example - Dropping a Table:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DROP TABLE Employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement removes the `Employees` table and all of its data from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **ALTER:**\n",
    "The `ALTER` statement is used to modify an existing database object, such as adding, modifying, or dropping columns in a table, or renaming an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example - Altering a Table (Adding a Column):\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE Employees\n",
    "ADD COLUMN Salary INT;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement adds a new column called `Salary` to the existing `Employees` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **TRUNCATE:**\n",
    "The `TRUNCATE` statement is used to remove all rows from a table while keeping the table structure intact. It's faster and more efficient than deleting all rows using the `DELETE` statement, especially for large tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example - Truncating a Table:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement removes all rows from the `Employees` table but keeps the table structure for future use.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, DDL statements (`CREATE`, `DROP`, `ALTER`, `TRUNCATE`) are used for defining, modifying, and managing the structure of database objects. They allow database administrators and developers to create tables, modify existing objects, remove objects, and truncate data, shaping the database schema to fit the application's requirements."

    "**DML (Data Manipulation Language)** is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used for managing data stored in a database. DML statements are used for inserting, updating, and deleting data in database tables. Here's an explanation of the DML statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **INSERT:**\n",
    "The `INSERT` statement is used to add new rows (records) to a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example - Inserting Data into a Table:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Age, Department)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, a new record is inserted into the `Employees` table with values for `EmployeeID`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, `Age`, and `Department`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **UPDATE:**\n",
    "The `UPDATE` statement is used to modify existing rows in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example - Updating Data in a Table:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "UPDATE Employees\n",
    "SET Age = 31, Department = 'Sales'\n",
    "WHERE EmployeeID = 1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement updates the `Age` and `Department` columns in the `Employees` table for the record where `EmployeeID` is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **DELETE:**\n",
    "The `DELETE` statement is used to remove existing rows from a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example - Deleting Data from a Table:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DELETE FROM Employees\n",
    "WHERE EmployeeID = 1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement deletes the record from the `Employees` table where `EmployeeID` is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these examples:\n",
    "- **`INSERT`** adds new data to a table.\n",
    "- **`UPDATE`** modifies existing data in a table based on a specified condition.\n",
    "- **`DELETE`** removes data from a table based on a specified condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "DML statements are fundamental for managing the data in a relational database. They allow for the addition, modification, and removal of data, enabling the dynamic nature of database-driven applications. It's crucial to use these statements with care and always include a `WHERE` clause in `UPDATE` and `DELETE` statements to avoid unintentional modifications or deletions of data."

    "\n",
    "### **SELECT Statement:**\n",
    "The `SELECT` statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. It allows you to specify the columns you want to retrieve, apply filtering conditions, sort the results, and perform various other operations on the data.\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This query retrieves only the `FirstName` and `LastName` columns from the `Employees` table.\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM Employees\n",
    "ORDER BY LastName ASC, FirstName ASC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This query retrieves all columns and sorts the results first by `LastName` in ascending order and then by `FirstName` in ascending order.\n",

    "**Primary Key:**\n",
    "A **primary key** is a unique identifier for a record in a database table. It uniquely identifies each record in the table, ensuring that no two records can have the same primary key value. The primary key column(s) must have unique values for each row, and it cannot contain NULL values. In most database management systems, primary keys also automatically imply the constraint of being NOT NULL. Primary keys are used to establish relationships between tables and are fundamental for maintaining data integrity and enabling efficient data retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a table `Students` with columns `StudentID`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, and `Age`. Here, `StudentID` can be the primary key. Each `StudentID` must be unique for every student record in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Foreign Key:**\n",
    "A **foreign key** is a field in a database table that is used to establish a link between two tables. It creates a relationship between the data in two tables by referencing the primary key of one table from another table. The table containing the foreign key is called the referencing table, and the table referenced by the foreign key is called the referenced table. Foreign keys are used to maintain referential integrity between the two related tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider two tables, `Orders` and `Customers`. `Orders` table has columns `OrderID`, `OrderDate`, and `CustomerID`, where `CustomerID` is a foreign key referencing the `CustomerID` column in the `Customers` table. In this case, `CustomerID` in the `Orders` table establishes a relationship with the `Customers` table, indicating which customer placed the order.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "- **Primary Key:** Unique identifier for a record in a table. Ensures data integrity and allows efficient data retrieval. A table can have only one primary key.\n",
    "- **Foreign Key:** A field in a table that establishes a link with the primary key of another table. It enforces referential integrity and creates relationships between tables in a database. A table can have multiple foreign keys, each referencing a different table's primary key."

    "1. **Connecting to MySQL Database:**\n",
    "   - Use `mysql.connector.connect()` to establish a connection to your MySQL database by providing the host, username, password, and database name.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Creating a Cursor:**\n",
    "   - Use the `cursor()` method on the connection object to create a cursor. The cursor is used to execute SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Executing Queries:**\n",
    "   - Use the `execute()` method on the cursor to execute SQL queries. Pass the SQL query as a string to this method. You can also use placeholders (%s) for data values in the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Fetching Data:**\n",
    "   - After executing a SELECT query, use the `fetchall()` method on the cursor to retrieve all rows of the result set. You can also use `fetchone()` to fetch a single row.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Committing Changes:**\n",
    "   - For data manipulation queries (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), use the `commit()` method on the connection to save the changes to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Closing Cursor and Connection:**\n",
    "   - After performing operations, it's essential to close the cursor and the connection to release resources. Use the `close()` method on both the cursor and the connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to replace `\"your_host\"`, `\"your_username\"`, `\"your_password\"`, and `\"your_database\"` with your actual MySQL database credentials and database name."

    "1. **FROM:** Specifies the tables from which to retrieve data.\n",
    "2. **JOIN:** Combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.\n",
    "3. **WHERE:** Filters rows based on specified conditions.\n",

    "\n",
    "It's important to note that not all clauses are required in a SQL query. The basic structure of a SELECT query includes FROM and SELECT clauses, but JOIN, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, DISTINCT, ORDER BY, LIMIT, and OFFSET clauses are optional and can be used based on the specific requirements of the query. The order in which they are written in the query generally follows the sequence mentioned above."
